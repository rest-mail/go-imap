# IMAP RFC checklist — PARTIAL checked foundation

This is an explicitly **PARTIAL** checklist: the first RFC 3501 rows for the
connection greeting, the any-state commands (CAPABILITY, NOOP, LOGOUT), LOGIN
and tagged completion. It is not an inventory of all applicable RFC
requirements, a full conformance claim, or a coverage badge. A mapped row means
its named wire test in `internal/rfctest` asserts the stated behavior through
the public `Session`; it does not prove the entire referenced section.

Requirements below paraphrase [RFC 3501](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3501.txt).
`Normative` denotes protocol text without an explicit RFC 2119 keyword.
CI runs `go run ./internal/checklist internal/rfctest`, which fails on an item
with no test, a test naming an unknown item, or a duplicate ID.

## RFC 3501: connection, any-state commands and LOGIN

| ID | Section | Level | Requirement | Tests |
|----|---------|-------|-------------|-------|
| IMAP-GREET-01 | RFC 3501 §§3.1, 7.1.1 | Normative | Greet with an untagged OK, which starts the not authenticated state; refuse SELECT before authentication. | TestGreeting |
| IMAP-CAP-01 | RFC 3501 §6.1.1 | MUST | Send a single untagged CAPABILITY response listing IMAP4rev1 before the tagged OK, in every state. | TestCapability |
| IMAP-NOOP-01 | RFC 3501 §6.1.2 | Normative | NOOP always succeeds, in any state. | TestNoop |
| IMAP-LOGOUT-01 | RFC 3501 §6.1.3 | MUST | Send an untagged BYE before the tagged OK to LOGOUT, then close the connection. | TestLogout |
| IMAP-LOGIN-01 | RFC 3501 §6.2.3 | Normative | LOGIN with valid credentials returns OK and enters the authenticated state; invalid credentials return NO and leave the state unchanged. | TestLogin |
| IMAP-TAG-01 | RFC 3501 §§2.2.1, 2.2.2 | Normative | The tagged completion result carries the tag of the command it completes. | TestTaggedCompletion |
| IMAP-BAD-01 | RFC 3501 §7.1.3 | Normative | An unknown command receives a tagged BAD. | TestTaggedCompletion |
